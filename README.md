# Cat or Dog Quiz Game
Welcome to the "Cat or Dog" quiz game! This project was created as a fun way to explore frontend development using React while combining a love for animals.

## About the Game
The game's concept is straightforward: you'll be presented with images, and your task is to decide whether the image features a cat or a dog by clicking the corresponding button.

As an animal lover, I found it exciting to work with free APIs that provide an endless supply of cat and dog images for this project.
